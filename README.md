# MeleeCombatSystem

##### Developed with Unreal Engine 5.1.1

##### Based on [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/ "Udemy course")

---
Game was made for the learning purposes. Current release is a simple shooter game with 3PP camera, where you need to find and kill all enemies on the map. 

First big "done" project. Learned how to implement AI(tasks, services, behavior tree, blackboard etc), work with animations, blend spaces and state machines, setting HUD using UMG module and more.
